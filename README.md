# Agent Profile

A local, privacy-first Rust CLI for selecting and launching profiles for multiple coding agents.

> `agent-profile` owns profile selection. The coding agent owns authentication and agent-specific
> configuration. The evidence determines what `agent-profile` is allowed to claim.

Agent Profile never copies credentials, extracts tokens, sends telemetry or trusts
repository-controlled profile selection.

**Status: scaffold.** The workspace, tooling and CI exist; no profile behaviour is implemented yet. The
authoritative design is
[`agent-profile-implementation-spec-v3.md`](agent-profile-implementation-spec-v3.md).

## Architecture

```text
CLI
  ↓
Configuration
  ↓
Repository Discovery
  ↓
Profile Resolution
  ↓
Agent Adapter
  ↓
LaunchPlan
  ↓
Process Launcher
  ↓
Coding Agent
```

Adapters produce a `LaunchPlan`; they never spawn processes.

## Usage (planned)

```text
agent-profile <agent> <profile> [WRAPPER OPTIONS] [-- <agent args...>]
agent-profile <agent> [WRAPPER OPTIONS] [-- <agent args...>]
```

Everything after `--` is passed to the agent untouched. Profile resolution order: explicit profile >
agent-specific repository mapping > repository-wide mapping > global default > none.

## Planned adapters — not yet implemented or evidence-verified

Each adapter ships only with a verified evidence entry and capability declaration. Until then, the
mechanisms below are the specification's starting point, not a claim about isolation.

| Agent | Primary mechanism | Intended semantic tier |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | Profile/environment isolation, with credential caveats |
| Codex CLI | native `--profile` / `CODEX_HOME` | Native profile |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI_CLI_HOME` | Home/state isolation |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | `COPILOT_HOME` | Home/config isolation |
| OpenCode | `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` / `OPENCODE_CONFIG` | Config/home isolation |
| Cline CLI | `--config`, `--data-dir` | Config/state selection |
| Pi | `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` | Agent home/state isolation |
| Kiro CLI | `KIRO_HOME` | Independent home/profile |
| Cursor Agent CLI | `CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR` | Configuration selection |
| Continue CLI | `--config` | Configuration selection |
| Aider | `--config` | Configuration selection |
| Amp | `--settings-file` | Settings selection |

## Workspace

| Crate | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `agent-profile` | Library (naming, configuration, repository discovery, resolution, adapters, launcher, CLI, output) and the `agent-profile` binary |
| `agent-profile` → `fake-agent` binary | Test-only stand-in for a coding agent (`src/bin/fake-agent.rs`); never shipped |

## Building

Requires Rust 1.98+ (edition 2024).

```
cargo build --workspace
just check              # the local gate: fmt + clippy + typos + test
```

Tooling is listed in [`docs/dev-tooling.md`](docs/dev-tooling.md); see
