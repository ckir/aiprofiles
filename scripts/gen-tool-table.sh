# Generates the "## Tools" table in docs/dev-tooling.md from .claude/recommended-tools.json, so the
# two lists (the doc a human reads, the JSON a hook reads) cannot drift apart the way they already had:
# `just` had no doc row despite gating everything, and Sandboxie-Plus — the sandbox that enforces
# "coding agents are never installed on the host" — was missing from the doc entirely.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/gen-tool-table.sh          # rewrite docs/dev-tooling.md in place
#   sh scripts/gen-tool-table.sh --check  # verify docs/dev-tooling.md is up to date; no writes
